# Mission-to-Mars - Web Scraping

## Project Overview
In this project, we assisted Robin, a new data analyst at SpaceForward, with gathering information about the climate on Mars. Utilizing automated browsing with Splinter and HTML Parsing with Beautiful Soup, we web-scraped the Mars news website to gather information for our deliverables.

## Summary & Conclusion

By web-scraping, we were able to efficiently scrape titles and preview text from the Mars News website and store our results in a MongoDB database titled mars_db.

We also scraped data from an HTML table on the Mars Temperature Data site, assembling the scraped data into a Pandas DataFrame, and finally exporting the dataframe to a CSV file.
